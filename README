system_i_audit
==============

Description:
This project performs an audit of system values, user/group profiles and privileges, and object authorities.
It can also track changes made to these areas over time by performing a diff against two runs of the script.  
This code is older and would require tweaking to work properly.

Usage:

as4.pl [-s IP] [-u username] [-p password] [--run [report|diff]] [--kill-chkpt] [-h]

-s            IP Address of AS400 server to be analyzed.
              This is a required parameter, even if doing a
              diff report as it is used in some file naming
              conventions.
			  
-u            Username to use to log into the AS400.

-p            Password to use to log into the AS400.","\n";

--run         The type of run the script should perform.
              This is ALWAYS a required parameter, and is either 
              'report' for a normal report run or a 'diff' for a
              diff of two previous runs.

--kill-chkpt  Specify this option to have the script kill 
              the checkpoint services.  Generally this
              should not be required, but may be at SMWE.

-h            Print this help.

Example Sessions:
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| cmd> as4.pl -s 192.168.1.24 -u xyz -p mypwd --run report  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
*This will perform a normal audit of the server at 192.168.1.24.
It will log in with the username and password specified with -u
and -p.  Note that this will use the network to run commands
on the server and extract the necessary data to perform the
audit.

|------------------------------------------------------|
| cmd> as4.pl -s 182.43.45.66 --run diff               |
|                                                      |
| Enter the PRE run directory: c:\pre\run\directory    |
|                                                      |
| Enter the POST run directory: c:\post\run\directory  |
|------------------------------------------------------|
*This will perform a diff of two previous runs log files.
All that required is to specify the path the previous runs
top-level directory (i.e. the as4.1.1.2007.6.6.6 directory).
